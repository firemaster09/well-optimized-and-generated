# well-optimized-and-generated
the source code of my modpack! :)
this modpack aims to optimize the game to the maximum (it is based on Fabulously Optimized) while adding a story with incredible bosses and aspects of medieval life for quieter players. Thanks to its fantastic quests it is great for both singleplayer and to play with friends. Note The modpack is still in beta and the story stops only at the second of the many bosses I intend to add. ⚠️ Important ⚠️ this modpack needs the mods: FTB teams, FTB library and FTB quests. i couldn't include them by default for copiright reasons :(

IMPORTANT !!!
you have to unzip the folder config to access the files
